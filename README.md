## About This Portfolio  
This portfolio contains my cybersecurity-related projects, including:  
- **Network Traffic Analysis Toolkit** ‚Äì A Python & Bash toolset for capturing, analyzing, detecting, and visualizing network traffic anomalies.  
- **Security Research & Learning Notes** ‚Äì Research articles and documentation on cybersecurity techniques, threat intelligence, and system vulnerabilities.  

These projects demonstrate my ability to work with **packet analysis (PCAPs), network monitoring, security scripting, and automated threat detection.**  

## Projects  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Network Traffic Analysis Toolkit**  
üìå **Description:**  
A set of Python and Bash scripts for **capturing, analyzing, detecting, and visualizing** network traffic patterns and security threats from PCAP files.  

üìÇ **Key Features:**  
- Capture real-time network traffic using `tcpdump`.  
- Analyze `.pcap` files to extract insights.  
- Detect suspicious patterns using Python-based anomaly detection.  
- Visualize results using Matplotlib and Pandas.  

üìú **Files & Scripts:**  
- [`capture_traffic.sh`](scripts/capture_traffic.sh) - Captures network traffic using `tcpdump`.  
- [`run_pcap_analysis.sh`](scripts/run_pcap_analysis.sh) - Automates packet analysis from captured files.  
- [`analyzer.py`](scripts/analyzer.py) - Extracts network insights from PCAP files.  
- [`detector.py`](scripts/detector.py) - Identifies anomalies in traffic.  
- [`visualizer.py`](scripts/visualizer.py) - Generates visual reports of network traffic.  

üì• **Installation & Usage:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-portfolio.git
cd cybersecurity-portfolio
bash capture_traffic.sh  # Start capturing network traffic
bash run_pcap_analysis.sh   # Automated analysis of pcap file (analyse-detect-visualise)
